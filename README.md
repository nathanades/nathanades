### Welcome! ðŸš€

I'm a software developer. My background is in front-end development using TypeScript, React, and Redux.

I'm more passionate about backend systems. My goal is to deliver valuable software by authoring clean and performant code, keep myself up to date and never stop improving.

I consider myself language agnostic, because languages and tools are just the means to an end.
