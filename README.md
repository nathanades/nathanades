### Welcome! ðŸš€

As a software engineer passionate for developing backend systems I'm excited by the growth of the field and the never-ending
challenges it provides. 

I think that software and code can be beautiful and elegant even if there is no UI involved!

Currently I'm enjoying learning Java, Spring, and microservices on a daily basis, as well as honing my DSA knowledge on LeetCode.
