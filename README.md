### Welcome! ðŸš€

I'm a software developer. My background is in front-end development using TypeScript, React, and Redux.

I'm more passionate about backend systems. My goal is to deliver valuable software by authoring clean and performant code, keep myself up to date and never stop improving.

I've made the difficult decision to quit my previous job as a frontend developer and pursue my passion for backend development around the clock. I'm currently using Java and Spring to develop my understanding and enhance my skills.

I like to think of myself as language agnostic. I maintain a language-agnostic approach and occasionally experiment with various languages and frameworks.
